#HitConfirm

Hit confirm is a browser extension which makes reading and sharing fighting game
combos easier, accepting tradition written combo notations and translating them
into icons similar to those which can be found in-game.

##Current Version (0.5)

The current version for Chrome accepts and translates notations for Tekken 7,
and should also be compatible with notations for older games in that series.

##Future Updates:

The next major revision will add the ability to save and annotate translated
strings for the next update; once that's done I'll probably be uploading the
chrome extension for public use. Beyond that I'm planning on writing a Firefox
extension and expanding compatibility to include other games, prioritizing
Street Fighter and Dragonball FighterZ. I don't have a set timetable for this
at the moment but I'm hoping on having them done as soon as possible.
